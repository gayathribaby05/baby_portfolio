This project focuses on developing a Real-Time Traffic Monitoring System that detects vehicles crossing a designated red line. It integrates object detection capabilities using the YOLO model with OpenCV and TensorFlow. The system processes high-resolution traffic videos (60 FPS) in real time, providing visual overlays and maintaining data logs for analysis.
